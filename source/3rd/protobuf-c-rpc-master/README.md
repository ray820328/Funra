[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/protobuf-c/protobuf-c-rpc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/protobuf-c/protobuf-c-rpc) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/protobuf-c/protobuf-c-rpc.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/protobuf-c/protobuf-c-rpc)

## Overview

This is `protobuf-c-rpc`, a library for performing RPC with `protobuf-c`. It was formerly integrated into the main `protobuf-c` distribution but has now been split out.

## Building

`protobuf-c-rpc` requires a C compiler, [protobuf-c](https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c), and `pkg-config` to be installed. `protobuf-c` itself requires [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) to be installed.

    ./configure && make && make install

If building from a git checkout, the `autotools` (`autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`) must also be installed, and the build system must be generated by running the `autogen.sh` script.

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install
